# calico
Calico project

This project originally created and implemented by Anup (https://github.com/anupsathya/calico). 

This is a simplify version to help future development.

DEPLOYMENT:
  to enable the color wheel option to work you must have a hosting
  for the http requests to work. For specific information feel free to
  reach out to me at noahtervalon@gmail.com you can host however you choose, but what I find easiest is to local
  host with python simple server. Run the following command in a shell: ```python3 -m http.server```
  and then you can access the web inteface in a browser with
    ```http://localhost:8000/Calico_Interface.html```
